***Move
Image
Crops for
Annotation 
(Move Image Crops for Annotation)** can be used to quickly classify objects such as species. The method does not classify all objects in a parent image; therefore, these data cannot be used for detection analysis.

The MICA (Move Image Crops for Annotation) Process:
1) Download imagery data of crops with context (see Imagery mgt and preprocessing)
2) View images in photo-viewing software like Infranview: https://www.irfanview.com/
3) When you can identify a species:
- Move the image to your own folder and name the folder with the 4-letter species code followed by your initials
e.g., BUFF_bp, COEI_bp
*****Do NOT copy the image! We are using a removal method and donâ€™t want to id the same image again and again*****
- Consider if you want other taxonomic groups such as genus or family
- To move a photo out of a folder, use Infranview: https://www.irfanview.com/ photo viewing software,hit F7 (recommended; else File > move).  You can then specify a shortcut key to the correct folder.
3) Focus on species that you can identify. Not all species are identifiable via crops and thatâ€™s okay.
4) When you have a completed folder, please use photo-viewing software, like Infranview: https://www.irfanview.com/, to double-check id of birds. For Infranview, open an image, set the zoom at 300-500% (see image below), and then go to View > Lock Zoom. Then you can simply use the arrow keys to run through all images in a folder. Use may also find it useful to use: File > thumbnails
